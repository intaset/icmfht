  <p class="body">Dr. Lixin Cheng is Principal Lecturer and Programme Leader in Chemical Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University, UK.  He obtained his Ph.D. in Thermal Energy Engineering at the State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow at Xi’an Jiaotong University, China in 1998. Dr. Cheng has extensive international working and collaboration experience. He held an associate professor in Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University, Denmark in 2013-2015. He was a senior lecturer and course leader in Petroleum Engineering at the University of Portsmouth, UK in 2011-2013, and a lecturer in Chemical Engineering at the University of Aberdeen, UK in 2009-2011. He worked as a scientific collaborator in the Laboratory of Heat and Mass Transfer (LTCM) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland in 2006-2009. He was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship and worked at the Institute of Process Engineering at the Leibniz University of Hanover, Germany in 2004-2006. He was a senior research fellow at London South Bank University in 2001-2003, and a post-doctoral research fellow at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands in 2000-2001. His research interests include multiphase flow and heat transfer, enhanced heat transfer, micro-scale two-phase flow and heat transfer, nanofluid two-phase flow and heat transfer, compact and micro-heat exchangers, chemical processes and thermal energy system etc. In recent years, he is active in developing cutting-edge interdisciplinary research such as bioenergy, waste utilization and energy efficiency. He has published more than 100 papers in journals and conferences, 10 book chapters and edited 10 books. He is associate editor of Heat Transfer Engineering since 2016. He was the founder and Editor-in-Chief of the <i>International Journal of Microscale and Nanoscale Thermal and Fluid Transport Phenomena (IJMNTFTP) (2010-2014)</i>. He is the Editor-in-Chief of e-book series <i>Advances in Multiphase Flow and Heat Transfer</i>, and editor of SpringerBriefs on <i>“Multiphase Flow”</i> and Book series <i>“Frontiers and Progress in Multiphase Flow”</i> by Springer Verlag in Germany.</p>

  <p class="bold">Dr. Andrzej Pacek</p><img src="../img/Pacek.jpg" width="200" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Professor Andrzej W Pacek received his Master degree from the Faculty of Power and Aeronautical Engineering at the Warsaw University of Technology.    After completing his PhD in Simultaneous Heat and Mass Transfer, he worked there as a senior lecturer.  In 1986 Dr Pacek moved to the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Birmingham, UK, where he still works as Professor of Multiphase systems, teaching Advanced Transport Phenomena, Heat Transfer, and Advanced Chemical Reactors.</p>
  <p class="body">His research group carries out theoretical and experimental investigations of transport phenomena in dispersed systems and the video-technique for in situ measurements of drops/bubbles/particles developed by Prof Pacek has been recently improved and combined with modified rheometer.  This system is now used to investigate the relation between rheology and morphology of multiphase systems.   Its new version enables simultaneous measurements of the size of dispersed entities and the shear forces acting on them, and in has been used in liquid/liquid systems and in aggregates/liquid systems.</p>
  <p class="body">Prof Pacek has been carrying out extensive investigations of stability of nano-particle suspensions, including the kinetics of breakage of micro-aggregates formed by nano-particles during dispersion of dry nano-powders in liquids.  Recently he was one of the leading members of EU sponsored NANOHEX project where the thermal and rheological properties of a wide range of nano-fluids and heat transfer coefficients in different flow geometries were investigated.</p>
  <p class="body">Prof Pacek’s research was supported directly by industry, UK government (EPSRC) and EU. Professor Pacek is an advisor for the Research Centre at the University of Porto, a member of editorial boards of several academic journals and a member of the EPSRC College.  He is also a visiting Professor at the Szczecin Technical University and delivered several invited lectures at national and international conferences and has extensively published in academic journals.</p>
