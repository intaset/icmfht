  <p class="body">Professor Lixin Cheng obtained his Ph.D. in Thermal Energy Engineering at the State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow at Xi’an Jiaotong University, China, in 1998. He was a senior lecturer and course leader in Petroleum Engineering at the University of Portsmouth, UK in 2011-2013, and was a lecturer in Chemical Engineering at the University of Aberdeen, UK in 2009-2011. He was a scientific collaborator of the Laboratory of Heat and Mass Transfer (LTCM) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland in 2006-2009. He was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship and worked at the Institute of Process Engineering at the Leibniz University of Hanover, Germany in 2004-2006. He was a senior research fellow at London South Bank University in 2001-2003, and a post-doctoral research fellow at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands in 2000 - 2001. His research interests include multiphase flow and heat transfer, enhanced heat transfer, micro-scale two-phase flow and heat transfer, nanofluid two-phase flow and heat transfer, compact and micro-heat exchangers, reactors, chemical processes and thermal energy systems. In recent years, he is active in developing cutting-edge interdisciplinary research such as bioenergy and biofuel subsea multiphase transport and separation technology, multiphase flow in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and energy efficiency using micro- and nano-structures etc. He has published more than 80 papers in journals and conferences, 8 book chapters and edited 10 books. He was the founder and Editor-in-Chief of the <i>International Journal of Microscale and Nanoscale Thermal and Fluid Transport Phenomena (IJMNTFTP)</i> (2010-2014) and is the editor of the new book series “Microscale and Nanoscale Thermal and Fluid Sciences” <i>(MNTFS)</i> in 2015. He is the Editor-in-Chief of e-book series <i>Advances in Multiphase Flow and Heat Transfer,</i> and editor of <i>SpringerBriefs on “Multiphase Flow” and Book series “Frontiers and Progress in Multiphase Flow”</i> by Springer Verlag in Germany.</p>
