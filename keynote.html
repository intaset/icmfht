  <p class="body">Professor Andrzej W Pacek received his Master degree from the Faculty of Power and Aeronautical Engineering at the Warsaw University of Technology.    After completing his PhD in Simultaneous Heat and Mass Transfer, he worked there as a senior lecturer.  In 1986 Dr Pacek moved to the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Birmingham, UK, where he still works as Professor of Multiphase systems, teaching Advanced Transport Phenomena, Heat Transfer, and Advanced Chemical Reactors.</p>
  <p class="body">His research group carries out theoretical and experimental investigations of transport phenomena in dispersed systems and the video-technique for in situ measurements of drops/bubbles/particles developed by Prof Pacek has been recently improved and combined with modified rheometer.  This system is now used to investigate the relation between rheology and morphology of multiphase systems.   Its new version enables simultaneous measurements of the size of dispersed entities and the shear forces acting on them, and in has been used in liquid/liquid systems and in aggregates/liquid systems.</p>
  <p class="body">Prof Pacek has been carrying out extensive investigations of stability of nano-particle suspensions, including the kinetics of breakage of micro-aggregates formed by nano-particles during dispersion of dry nano-powders in liquids.  Recently he was one of the leading members of EU sponsored NANOHEX project where the thermal and rheological properties of a wide range of nano-fluids and heat transfer coefficients in different flow geometries were investigated.</p>
  <p class="body">Prof Pacekâ€™s research was supported directly by industry, UK government (EPSRC) and EU. Professor Pacek is an advisor for the Research Centre at the University of Porto, a member of editorial boards of several academic journals and a member of the EPSRC College.  He is also a visiting Professor at the Szczecin Technical University and delivered several invited lectures at national and international conferences and has extensively published in academic journals.</p>
