  <p class="body">Dr. Afshin J. Ghajar is <i>Regents and John Brammer Endowed Professor</i> in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA and a Honorary Professor of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China. He received his BS, MS, and Ph.D. all in Mechanical Engineering from Oklahoma State University. His expertise is in experimental heat transfer/fluid mechanics and development of practical engineering correlations. His current research is in two-phase flow heat transfer/pressure drop studies in pipes with different orientations, heat transfer/pressure drop in mini/micro tubes, and heat transfer/pressure drop in the transition region (plain and enhanced tubes). He and his co-workers have published over 200 reviewed research papers. He has delivered numerous keynote and invited lectures at major technical conferences and institutions. He has received several outstanding teaching/service awards over the years. His latest awards are the 75thAnniversary Medal of the ASME Heat Transfer Division <i>"in recognition of his service to the heat transfer community and contributions to the field"</i> and the ASME ICNMM 2016 Outstanding Leadership Award, <i>this award recognizes a person whose service within the ICNMM (International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels, and Minichannels) is exemplary; the recipient of the award contributed significantly to the lasting success of the conference.</i> Dr. Ghajar is a <i>Fellow</i> of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), <i>Heat Transfer Series Editor</i> for CRC Press / Taylor & Francis and <i>Editor-in-Chief</i> of <i>Heat Transfer Engineering</i>, an international journal published eighteen times per year by Taylor and Francis. Dr. Ghajar is also the co-author of the 5th Edition of Cengel and Ghajar, <i><u>Heat and Mass Transfer – Fundamentals and Applications</u></i>, McGraw-Hill, 2015.</p>

  <p class="body">Tassos Karayiannis studied at the City University London and the University of Western Ontario (Western). He started his career as a researcher at Southampton University and later as a British Technology Group Researcher at City University. Subsequently he worked at London South Bank University and joined Brunel University London in 2005 where he is now professor of Thermal Engineering and Leader of the Energy Efficient & Sustainable Technologies Theme. Professor Karayiannis has carried out fundamental and applied research in a number of heat transfer related topics including natural convection and renewable energy. He has been involved with two-phase flow and heat transfer for over 30 years. Initially he worked on the enhancement of pool boiling and condensation processes using high intensity electric fields (Electrohydrodynamic enhancement of Heat Transfer). In parallel, he carried out extensive experimental work in pool boiling heat transfer with plane and enhanced surfaces. Professor Karayiannis has also been very actively involved with research in flow boiling in small to micro tubes and micro-multi-channels. This work involves fundamental studies as well as research leading to the design of high heat flux integrated thermal management systems. His research has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Innovate UK and Industry.  He has published more than 230 papers, chapters in books and industrial reports. He chaired the following conferences/meetings:  48th European Two Phase Flow Group Meeting, 2010 the 9th UK-Japan Seminar on Multiphase flows 2013 and the 15th UK National Heat Transfer Conference, 2017. He also chairs the Int Conf on Micro and Nanoscale flows now in its 6th edition. He is a Fellow of the EI and the IMechE and the Chairman of the UK National Heat Transfer Committee.</p>
